Solutions (__SPOILERS!__)

| Day  | Link  | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_one/Solution.java)  | part 2 seemed tougher (relatively) than last year!  |
| 2  | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_two/Solution.java)  | relatively straightforward, nice chilled Saturday :)  |
| 3  | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_3/main.go) | first attempt was completely arse-about-face. Had a walk and a strong coffee and got it done lol  |
| 4  | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_4/main.go) | part 1 was simple enough, part 2 was ok too tbh - always struggle with recursive problems so quite happy that I cracked it relatively quickly :) |
