Solutions (__SPOILERS!__)

| Day  | Link  | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1  | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_one/Solution.java)  | part 2 seemed tougher (relatively) than last year!  |
| 2  | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_two/Solution.java)  | relatively straightforward, nice chilled Saturday :)  |
| 3  | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_3/main.go) | first attempt was completely arse-about-face. Had a walk and a strong coffee and got it done lol  |
| 4  | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_4/main.go) | part 1 was simple enough, part 2 was ok too tbh - always struggle with recursive problems so quite happy that I cracked it relatively quickly :) |
| 5 | [C#](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/dotnet/day_5/Program.cs) | part 1 was noice, got a decent range based solution that solved in <1ms... part 2 miscalculated how long the brute force should run for, which cost me a *lot* of time debugging 😰 If in doubt just keep it running :) |
| 6 | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_6/Solution.java) | After yesterdays brain teaser today was a nice break, just needed a little bit of old-skool maths and a little bit of parsing. Phew |
| 7 | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_7/main.go) | honestly embarrassed by the brute force on this one :D - my excuse was that I was working in a loud co-working space so couldn't concentrate 😅 |
| 8 | [Ruby](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/ruby/day_8/solution.rb) | ahh back to Ruby, makes parsing things sooo much simpler :) needed a little hint on part 2, but on the whole it went quite smoothly |
| 9 | [Ruby](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/ruby/day_9/solution.rb)| Quite happy with todays solution as knocked it out in 20 mins :D - the best part was I just needed a little trick to solve part 2 🙂 |
| 10 | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_10/Solution.java)| currently just part one - WIP ;) |
| 11 | [Ruby](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/ruby/day_11/solution.rb)| Just part 1 again - overengineered a shortest path algorithm, which wasn't required.. makes part 2's runtime a _tad_ too long :D |
| 12 | [?]()| Honestly really struggled with day 12, just couldn't even get my head around the problem to start with 😅 Will come back to it _soon_ ™️ |
| 13 | [Go](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/go/day_13/main.go) | Part 1 in Go... Monitoring my fun levels, as these challenges are starting to tax me a little too much 😅. As long as i'm learning though, that's the main thing :) |
| 14 | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_14/Solution.java) | Part 1 in Java - a few wrinkles we need to iron out before attempting part 2 :) |
| 15 | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_15/Solution.java)| Part 1 in Java - again just part one as was a little hungover/busy hehe|
| 16 | [Java](https://github.com/eddbot/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/src/main/java/com/murismo/solution/day_16/Solution.java)| Part 1 and 2, had a bit of time on Sunday afternoon so managed to get both parts of this wrapped up :) |
